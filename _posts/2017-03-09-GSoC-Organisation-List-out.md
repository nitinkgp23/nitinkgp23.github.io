27th of February, it is. I am enjoying at a party with the other KOSS people. Somewhere far away, a PR was getting merged, to show to the world (not literally, only the GSoC aspirants) which organizations would participate in Google Summer of Code 2017. I didn’t have to worry (_Overconfidence_) , cause I was sure OpenAstronomy would be selected.

I had been involved with SunPy over a fortnight now, and I was sure of doing a project under this org. Although, I am not an astrophysicist (nor I plan to be :p), my long lost interest in astronomy came back alive when I started working with this org. All those times in my high school, when I dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist, or reading about Einstein’s Theory of Relativity and spending hours understanding the Twin’s paradox or Lorrentz’s contraction. Ahh! Those days. And, then somehow, software caught me. :/

But, who knew I would someday be developing such cool software and working on such interesting projects, all related to astronomy and our very own, the Sun!

I started to look for some bugs that I could solve, and some documentation fixes that I could do, that would help me get familiar with the code base. I had to decide a project too, and I got a wonderful one that fitted all my interests. Having done some image-processing before, I had to develop whole of a library in SunPy, named Sunkit-image, that would deal with all the image processing routines in solar analysis.

Currently, I am working on my proposal, trying to understand the codebase as much as I can, reading up papers, getting intimidated by how cool things our scientists do!
