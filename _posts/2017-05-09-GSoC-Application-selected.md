Well, I was on a trek this week, on a height of about 4000 meters and it wasn’t a surprise that I had no network there. The day the GSoC results came, I was unaware of all the happenings going down there. I was dying to get back down, and see whether my 2 months of toiling hard work had born fruit.

I had managed to submit two proposals in SunPy before the deadline. Yes, TWO! In my last blog post, I talked about how interesting the project Sunkit-image sounded to me, and how I was looking forward to prepare a proposal for it. Anyways, things changed a bit, when Cadair asked to me look a bit on the other project- improving the Drms module for JSOC downloads.

This was the project I had initially chosen to work on, but had dropped it due to lack of ideas. Things came back to life when the project came up on the ideas page and when I had a thorough discussion with Kolja, the main developer of the drms package.

Finally, after a series of night-outs and toiling hard work, I was successful in submitting both the proposals — one for the Sunkit-image and the other for Drms module for JSOC Downloads.

And guess what, the Drms project was finally selected! Looking forward to having a great summer ahead, while I work with Kolja and Monica (my mentors for this project) to improve the drms module and the JSOC Client.

Cheers.
