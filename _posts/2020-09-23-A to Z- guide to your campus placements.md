Welcome to the A to Z_ guide for cracking your CDC Placements, (or any interview preparation for that matter). This post has been due a long time, and I am glad, I am finally publishing this. Please note that this guide is not exclusive, and is only based on my personal experience, and those of my friends, who appeared in the placement process in December 2019. I have tried to cover almost everything that I experienced in the journey, but might obviously have missed some important things, and hence I don't claim this guide to be A-Z but instead A-Z_ (approaching Z from the left).

#### My Background

I majored in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2020. I had a chance to appear in the placement session of 2019, and got successfully placed in Cohesity. Currently, I am working at Cohesity in the field of Distributed File Systems.

#### Who is this blog for?
I believe that this blog will be helpful to everyone preparing for a profile in Software Development, but people preparing for Machine Learning/Data Science or Quant roles can give this a read too. I have listed all relevant resources at the end, for each of the 3 profiles separately.

Also, it is important to mention that prior to 5 months before my interview, I had no knowledge of Data Structures/Algorithms whatsoever, other than the basic PDS course that I did in my 1st year. So, I will write this blog keeping in mind that you haven't had prior exposure to Algo-DS too, and how to prepare for this from scratch.

## Crux

All right, without further ado, let's directly come to the point. I have divided my blog (and the whole preparation timeline) to 3 phases. Phase I extends from the time you start your preparation to 1.5 months (or, 1 month if you dont have enough time) prior to your interview. Phase II lies from 1.5 months (or, 1 month) before your interview to 2 days prior to your interview. Phase III is the grand finale, the 2 days prior to your interview to the time you had an offer in your hand.

### Phase I

A good time to start your placement preparation is 5 months prior to your interview, and so, here I will consider the start of this phase to be this date. If you happen to start the preparation late, do not worry. You can skip a few things that are mentioned here, and plan it accordingly.

##### Coding
The three most important resources for anyone to prepare for a coding profile are Geeks for Geeks, LeetCode and InterviewBit. I will suggest you to use GeeksForGeeks as a handbook and your go-to guide for understanding the theory and looking at standard solutions. LeetCode and InterviewBit should be your go-to point for solving questions. 
###### GeeksForGeeks
Go through GeeksForGeeks thoroughly, especially Data Strucutres and Algorithms. Read about linked-lists, stacks and queues, and trees. Each of these topics have a ton of questions listed. Go through some of the questions and their solutions for each topic. You will understand how problems are solved. Do not attempt to solve them on your own, just go through to get an overview of the data strucutre or algorithm.

Keep visiting this website whenever you are stuck, or your concept regarding a certain data-strucuture/algorithm isn't clear. 
###### InterviewBit
InterviewBit has a lesser number of questions and are more focused, so I will strongly recommend to finish InterviewBit atleast once. Aim to have a score > 25k.
###### LeetCode
Leetcode has a lot more questions than InterviewBit (~1.5k). You obviously don't need to solve all of them. I suggest, to try to solve atleast 150-200 questions (50 easy, 100 medium, 30 hard). You will find most of the questions already solved in InterviewBit, and this will be a revision for you.

Top 200 LeetCode questions: The problem with LeetCode questions is you don't know which questions to solve from this collection! For this, I have prepared a list of all LeetCode questions arranged in order of likes. More liked a question is, more popular and more frequently it is asked in an interview. Aim to solve the questions in this order, and reach as far as you can.. (Maybe 200?)

LeetCode weekly contest: Once you have a good hold on concepts, and have solved a good number of questions ranging from all topics, you should start to have a feel of what actual tests are like. LeetCode weekly contest is a good way to solve new questions and with the timer running.

##### Machine Learning/Data Science

##### Quant

### Phase II

You have approximately 1.5 months to go before you face your interviewer. Consider this phase to start, when your placement tests are about to start, or have just started. This is the time to focus on how to crack your placement tests primarily. Once all of your placement tests are over, you should start preparing for interviews.

##### Placement tests

Once tests begin, stop solving new questions from LeetCode. This is the time to:
+ Revise all standard questions/concepts. Revise the notes that you prepared from your Phase I.
+ Solve questions from Placement Docs. You will be surprised to see the previous year questions that company asked. You will have seen none of them in LeetCode/InterviewBit, and this may seem a bit scary. But don't worry. Questions that are asked in placement tests are generally new, which you haven't seen before, and hence you need to practice these questions. 
##### Interview preparation
Once all tests are over, its time to start preparing for your interview.
+ Prepare your Resume
+ Stop coding; Start solving questions on paper
+ InterviewBit Mock Interview
+ GfG ramp-up
+ Revise basic data strucutres and thier implementation
### Phase III
##### Before Interview
##### Interview

### Company-wise experience
### FAQs
### Resources
