Welcome to the A to Z⁻ guide for cracking your CDC Placements, (or any coding interview preparation for that matter). This post has been due a long time, and I am glad, I am finally publishing this. Please note that this guide is not exclusive, and is only based on my personal experience, and those of my friends, who appeared in the placement process in December 2019. I have tried to cover almost everything that I experienced in the journey, but might obviously have missed some important things, and hence I don't claim this guide to be A-Z but instead A-Z⁻ (approaching Z from the left).

## My Background

I majored in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2020. I had a chance to appear in the placement session of 2019, and got successfully placed in Cohesity. Currently, I am working at Cohesity in the field of Distributed File Systems.

## Who is this blog for?
I believe that this blog will be helpful to everyone preparing for a profile in Software Development, but people preparing for Machine Learning/Data Science or Quant roles can give this a read too. I have listed all relevant resources at the end, for each of the 3 profiles separately.

Also, it is important to mention that prior to 5 months before my interview, I had no knowledge of Data Structures/Algorithms whatsoever, other than the basic PDS course that I did in my 1st year. So, I will write this blog keeping in mind that you haven't had prior exposure to Algo-DS too, and how to prepare for this from scratch.

---------

## Crux

All right, without further ado, let's directly cut to the chase. I have divided my blog (and the whole preparation timeline) to 3 phases. Phase I extends from the time you start your preparation to 1.5 months (or, 1 month if you dont have enough time) prior to your interview. Phase II lies from 1.5 months (or, 1 month) before your interview to 2 days prior to your interview. Phase III is the grand finale, the 2 days prior to your interview to the time you had an offer in your hand.

### Phase I

A good time to start your placement preparation is 5 months prior to your interview, and so, here I will consider the start of Phase I to be this date. If you happen to start the preparation late, do not worry. You can skip a few things that are mentioned here, and plan it accordingly.

**Coding**

The three most important resources for anyone to prepare for a coding profile are Geeks for Geeks, LeetCode and InterviewBit. I will suggest you to use GeeksForGeeks as a handbook and your go-to guide for understanding the theory and looking at standard solutions. LeetCode and InterviewBit should be your go-to point for solving questions. 

1. [**Geeks For Geeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

    Go through GeeksForGeeks thoroughly, especially Data Strucutres and Algorithms. Read about linked-lists, stacks and queues, and trees. Each of these topics have a ton of questions listed. Go through some of the questions and their solutions for each topic. You will understand how problems are solved. Do not attempt to solve them on your own, just go through to get an overview of the data strucutre or the algorithm.

    Keep visiting this website whenever you are stuck, or your concept regarding a certain data-strucuture/algorithm isn't clear.



2. [**Interview Bit**](https://www.interviewbit.com/)

    InterviewBit is the best place to start solving questions. All questions are divided into certain sections, and it helps you to do an efficient topic-wise preparation. It starts with easier topics like Arrays and Linked Lists and then proceeds to Trees and DP and ends with Graphs. Each section has a short tutorial to help you clear the syntax and other basic concepts.
    InterviewBit questions are more focused to each topic, and this will help you cover each topic one by one. This is especially important when you are starting out, and you may not which questions belong to which topic. So, I will strongly recommend to finish InterviewBit atleast once. Aim to have a score > 25k.

    **Tip**: Don't get discouraged while you are solving questions from 'Arrays'. The questions in that section are tougher than usual. You will find it easy once you move down to Linked Lists and Trees.




3. [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/)

    Leetcode has a lot more questions than InterviewBit (~ 1.5k). You obviously don't need to solve all of them. I suggest, to try to solve atleast 150-200 questions (50 easy, 100 medium, 30 hard). You will find most of the questions already solved in InterviewBit, and this will be a revision for you.


    LeetCode has a different performace measuring system than InterviewBit. In LeetCode, you should strive for having greater than 80 percentile score on your time and space. **LeetCode is the best place to find the best solutions to any question**. Just head over to 'Discussion' section of a question, and find the solutions that are voted best. Going through these will help you improve the quality of your code, and the way you approach a problem.


    [Top 200 LeetCode questions](https://nitinkgp23.github.io/2019/09/25/Leetcode/): The problem with LeetCode questions is you don't know which questions to solve from this collection! For this, I have prepared a list of all LeetCode questions arranged in order of likes. More liked a question is, more popular and more frequently it is asked in an interview. Aim to solve the questions in this order, and reach as far as you can.. (Maybe 200?)


    [LeetCode weekly contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/): Once you have a good hold on concepts, and have solved a good number of questions ranging from all topics, you should start to have a feel of what actual tests are like. LeetCode weekly contest is a good way to solve new questions and with the timer running.



Some points to note:

+ Dynamic Programming is the most important topic to prepare among all. Pay special attention to this, and solve as many questions as you can related to DP. 
+ Questions from Binary Search can sometimes be tricky, and be applied in unusual places. You will/have come across [Painter's Partition Problem](https://geekstocode.com/the-painters-partition-problem/).
+ [Topological Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/) and [Union-find](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/) are quite important in Graphs.
+ [Trie](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/) is another important topic to look into. This may be a bit advance, but is important for interviews.
+ Binary Index Trees and Segment Trees are quite advance, and will not generally be asked in an interview. (Except, maybe Google?)


**Machine Coding**

Some companies in their interviews ask you to design simple applications on a whiteboard. You are expected to know how Object Oriented system works, and how to write modular code. For practice, you can try designing [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/en) or [Snake and Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders).

Have a look at this [website](https://workat.tech/machine-coding) to get some idea about what is expected of you in a machine coding round.


**Machine Learning/ Data Science**

For preparing for Data Science roles, there is no one fixed source. My recommendation is to prepare a list of topics to cover, and study each topic separately. The amount of depth you should go into for each topic varies based on the company. Some companies expect you to understand the derivations behind each equation governing the certain technique and some companies will only care whether you know the technique and how to apply them in practice.

A good rule of hand, is to go in as much depth as you can, *in those topics which you have mentioned in your resume*. For example, if you have mentioned SVM in your resume, you are expected to know what margins and kernel trick are (with, the maths governing it!). For things you have not mentioned in your resume, you should have a breadth of knowledge, and should know which techniques are to be applied in which cases, and the various drawbacks and advantages of the techniques. To achieve a *breadth of knowledge*, my recommendation is to read as many ML-related blogs as possible.

Another important point to note is that companies coming for 'Data Scientist' roles, do **not** necessarily ask questions from Data Science in their shortlisting test. Almost all companies coming for Data Science profiles (except Microsoft DS, in our year) had a coding round too where questions were asked from Algo/DS. Hence it is important for you to get your coding strong, as this is almost always the shortlisting criteria. Data Science knowledge is more of a requirement during your interview.



### Phase II

You have approximately 1.5 months to go before you face your interviewer. Consider this phase to start, when your placement tests are about to start, or have just started. This is the time to focus on how to crack your placement tests primarily. Once all of your placement tests are over, you should start preparing for interviews.

1. **Placement tests**

    Once tests begin, stop solving new questions from LeetCode. This is the time to:
    + Revise all standard questions/concepts. Revise the notes that you prepared from your Phase I. Go through questions that you might have bookmarked, or you wanted to take another look. 
    + Solve questions from Placement Docs. You will be surprised to see the previous year questions that company asked. You will have seen none of them in LeetCode/InterviewBit, and this may seem a bit scary. But don't worry. Questions that are asked in placement tests are generally new, which you haven't seen before. Going through previous year questions will help you have an idea on what kind of questions to expect in test. Placement Docs are regularly updated in this [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1540488506008368/).

2. **Interview preparation**

    Once all tests are over, its time to start preparing for your interview.
    
    **Prepare your Resume**

    + I reiterate *Prepare your resume very very well.* This is one part, that can *break* your interview. Not all companies have a specific 'Resume round', but your interviewer might glance at your resume in a coding round and throw you a question based on one of your projects that you did, or a course that you took. Remember, you can afford to not answer a coding question but you *cannot* afford to not answer a question based on your internship/project. That puts a bad impression on the interviewer.
    
    + Prepare short notes based on each project/internship that you did. Go back to your notes from the internship or the presentation, and study them well. Understand all techniques that you used at that time. Prepare a *critical analysis* on why you chose to go with a certain technique and not with something else. Revise all the courses that you mentioned on your resume.


    **Stop coding; Start solving questions on paper**

    + Start practising solving questions on paper. You will notice that this is not entirely same as writing code on a code editor. You will have to think of the solution beforehand, have a clear understanding of the approach, and only then start converting it on paper. Try to keep the code as clean as possible: making it messy implies you did't have a clear approach in your mind when you started. Also, *no psuedo code*. Write the code in proper syntax.


    **InterviewBit Mock Interview**

    + InterviewBit also has a Mock Interview feature where you can schedule interviews with a stranger, and you take turns interviewing each other. This proves to be fruitful in getting a actual feel of the interview.

    **Basic Data-Structures ramp-up**

    + Go through the Data Structures from Geeks for Geeks again. Do you remember how to implement QuickSort or a priority-queue? The implementations of basic Data-structures or algorithms are rarely used while coding, since you directly use STL library. But, it is important to brush them up, since these can be easily be asked in an interview.  

    **Geeks For Geeks Interview Questions**

    + Go through common [company-wise interview questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-coding-questions-company-wise/) from Geeks for Geeks. During the hiring season, common ongoing interview questions are also updated in LeetCode.



### Phase III

Welcome to the grand finale! Now is the time to stop learning new things, and revise whatever you have learnt uptil this point.

**Before Interview**

Prepare a short note on basic interview questions like your introduction, your strength and weaknesses etc. These are generic questions, and are not usually asked in Software development profile, but it is always good to be prepared.

Brush up your resume, revise your notes, and keep calm.

**During Interview**

The interview days can be quite tiring. Be prepared. Have a good night's sleep because the next days can be very tiring. Plan your companies beforehand according to your shortlists. If you have more than 2 shortlists in a company in one half of the day, you will have to prioritize. Talk to placecoms about your preference, and they will try their best to accomodate you accordingly. 

Also, once you have an offer from a company, you *cannot appear for an interview for any other company*, even if it is in the same day or the same half. Therefore, prioritizing becomes quite important. You do not want to sit for an interview, just "for trying it out". If you happen to get selected, you cannot back down.

## Some Tips and Tricks

----

## FAQs

1. **Does Department matter ?**

    Unfortunately, yes. It matters quite a lot, especially for software profile companies coming in Day 1/2. The difference arises in 2 ways: one, companies opening for CS/ECE/EE/Maths are quite more than other branches, and two, even if companies open for other branches, companies have a bias towards CS/ECE/EE/Maths students while shortlisting them for interviews.

    Another difference is, companies have a higher CGPA cutoff to let candidated appear in tests, for other branches, compared to CS/ECE/EE/Maths. For example, a certain company X, but might have a CGPA cutoff of 7.0 for CS/ECE/EE/Maths, but 8.0 for other branches.


2. **Does CGPA matter ?**

    Yes. Having a higher CGPA is always a plus, both while getting shortlisted for interviews and clearing them. Although, you don't necessarily need to have a CGPA of 9.5+, but having a CGPA of 8.5 gives you the ticket to appearing in the tests of all the companies that open for your department.
    
    If you are from CS/ECE/EE/Maths, but have a CGPA <8, you may miss out on some companies, like Samsung Research, Paypal, Apple, Cohesity, Nutanix etc.
    CGPA also matters if you are from non-circuital branches, as discussed above. These branches might have a higher CGPA criteria to appear in the company's tests.


3. **Does AIR matter ?**

    Well, this is a funny question, but 99% of the companies don't ask about your All India Rank in JEE. The other 1% includes trading firms like Quadeye.
